                        <p>I am Ashish Kondra. My interest lies in data science and data analytics. I was always passionate about pursuing a career along the same lines. I am working with Axis Bank in the role of data analyst, the majority of projects I work on include a blend of finance and SQL.

How did you decide on the specific role and company you wanted to apply for?
I found my interests lie in this field and my projects/skillset/experiences are more inclined towards the same. So, I was confident that I would apply for the roles of data science /data analytics. However, I had no restrictions on companies.

                        <p>Was the domain you applied for during placements the same as the one you interned in during your third-year? If not, why so?
I couldn't get an internship through campus. Also, I didn't try apping externally. I focussed more on DSA, completing relevant courses in Coursera, and some nice projects during vacation.

How crucial were the pre-placement talks and would you recommend attending them?
I do recommend attending them. You get to know about the company which can help in the HR interview

How was the selection process?
shortlist>aptitude and technical Test>interview, this is a generic selection process. Being conceptually strong and having strong domain knowledge helps clear the interviews

What were the shortlisting criteria for the company?
The test shortlist had a cutoff of 6. The interview shortlist was done based on test results

                        <p>How many students were there initially who applied or got shortlisted?
Roughly around 35 students were shortlisted for interview of which 9 were selected

What were the different rounds?
Aptitude and technical test> technical interview

Are there any set of repetitive que or cases that you noticed especially in HR or GD
There was only a technical interview focussing mostly on resume and few ML algorithms 
</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-c3">
                      <img src="Picture3.PNG">
                      <p>
How did you prepare for each round? Are there any resources or tips that you would like to share?
For technical tests, it is advised to work hard on DSA. Solve plenty of problems. No special focus was put on aptitude tests, it was mainly quant, logical, and grammar. For technical interviews get conceptually strong and clear on domain knowledge. HR interviews in general have a similar set of questions, so, practice them beforehand

If you have had to do your prep all over again, what changes would you do
No changes, I did my preparation fairly well. Start early, and figure out what more needs to be done to get the role that you wished for, organize resources, and make a plan to complete it in time. 

Key learnings from the process and a final note for fourthies
These few months are tiring, consistent efforts will be required. Do not get depressed if you couldn't get selected for any company that you wished for, keep looking actively and work hard for the next opportunity coming for you. All the very best
