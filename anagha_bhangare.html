                        <p>Hello everyone! This blog is from someone who was probably just as confused during my internship season as you are now :) I am Anagha Bhangare, a fourthie from the Chemical Engineering Department, and I did my summer internship at Piramal Pharma Limited. The 2-month long internship started mid-May and ended in July. I was assigned a project at Piramal’s Ennore (Chennai) Site, which is a production site for several pharma molecules such as mebeverine.  </p>
                        <p> Induction : <br>
The internship kickstarted with a 2-day long induction at the Kurla office. During this time, sessions were conducted by Piramal leaders (including the chairperson as well as the CEO) from all over the world who gave us insights on the roles and responsibilities of each department and the core values of the company. This was accompanied by a corporate lunch with the leaders and fun games and quizzes :D Following this, we were flown to our respective sites.  </p>

                        <p>About the Site & the Project : <br>
The Ennore site is located at the northernmost tip of Chennai whereas the accommodation provided by Piramal was in south Chennai. However, company buses were available for pick-up and drop from the company guesthouse to the site. The work culture at the site was great. After overcoming the initial language barrier I faced, I found everyone at the site to be very approachable, welcoming and helpful.  </p>
                    </div>
                <div class="blog-c2">
                        <p>My project was to reduce the energy consumption of the Effluent Treatment Plant at the Ennore site by 5% from the baseline of FY-22 energy consumption. After a brief 2-day induction at the site, I met with my mentor and got to work. Interestingly, this project was an 80-20 blend of non-core and core approaches. First half was dedicated to data collection, analysis and identifying potential areas of improvement. After the midterm, I worked on cost analysis (capex and opex) and calculating ROI of the suggested modifications. My mentor was super helpful throughout the internship and guided me effectively at every step.<br><br>
                            Selection Procedure: <br>
The selection process consisted of four rounds: resume screening, online test, GD and personal interview. The online test consisted of core questions along with puzzles, logical and verbal reasoning sections. The GD was pretty unconventional. We were given a plane crash scenario and were asked the items that we would carry from it and were also asked to explain facebook to a 6-year-old. Finally, my interview had only 1 round (technical + HR) which was intense. I was asked core-related questions, projects in my resume and general HR questions like interests, future plans etc.<br><br>

Ending note : <br><br>

All the logistics like food, travel and accommodation were taken care of wonderfully by the HR team. Under the Global Emerging Leaders Program, emphasis was given to overall development in the form of weekly sessions with the leaders at PPS. Working with Piramal Pharma is a matchless experience which will certainly provide you with a steep learning curve. <br>

All the best! </p>
